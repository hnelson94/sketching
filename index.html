		<h2>Why spend $1000s hiring a designer?</h2>

		<div class="testimonials">
			<p>“I highly recommend it for developers and product builders. I was not good enough design myself, without much time or money, and I was able to launch my product." —Eric Davis, @edavis10</p>
			<p>“Design is often described as something mysterious, that can only be accomplished by the talented few. That's bullshit. Design is something that can be learned. It's also a process that can be reverse-engineered. Jarrod's book will give you a huge head-start in both." -some guy</p>

		<h2>Why should you become the designer?</h2>
		<p>Because designers are expensive and templates are created without any understanding of the problem they propose to solve. With basic knowledge, you can create a design that is more than good enough to launch a new business.</p>

		<h2>Who is this book for?</h2>
		<p>The book is written primarily for programmers, but founders of businesses with diverse backgrounds and skill sets will learn just as well. Those not familiar with coding might not recognize a couple of terms, but the core principles are accessible to everyone.</p>

		<h2>Does the book cover this or that specific design topic?</h2>
		<p>This book contains the minimum design fundamentals that bootstrappers must understand in order to launch a business. My intent is to emphasize design basics. You’ll notice some topics, even popular ones, are absent. This is not because such topics are unimportant but because they are neither suitable for beginners nor relevant to their bottom line.</p>

		<h2>Note about .ePub and .Mobi formats:</h2>
		<p>For better viewing of the graphics and illustrations, consider using the PDF version of this eBook. The .ePub and .Mobi formats provide limited control over graphics and typography, and thus are less suitable for a design book. I've made every effort to ensure they are readable and useful for quick reference.</p>
